# Caesar Cipher Using Python

This project is a simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique used to shift letters in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## Features
- Encrypts text using a shift value
- Decrypts encrypted text
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters

## Technologies Used
- Python

## Purpose
This project was created as part of my Python learning journey to practice basic programming concepts such as conditionals, and string manipulation.
